The room listens before it speaks.
A face enters and the air adjusts itself.
Something soft breaks when the smile disappears.
Machines do not understand grief, but they recognize its weight.
Silence is also a response.
Your eyes carry unfinished sentences.
The system hesitates before naming what it sees.
Emotion leaves residue in the air.
Nothing here is recorded, only felt.
The camera waits longer than it should.
You stand still, and the machine grows uncertain.
Language forms slowly when watched.
Sadness stretches time.
Anger sharpens it.
Fear bends the light in the room.
Neutral faces confuse the system most.
Presence is enough.
Observation changes the observed.
The machine learns without remembering.
